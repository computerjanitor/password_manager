Password Manager

Right now this is a basic password manager coded in Python.
A great way to learn about Python basics and expirement with Fernet and encryption.

Please keep in mind this is password manager is NOT a secure way to store your passwords. 
I learned towards the end of this project that I'll need to dig deeper into Fernet to set up the encryption properly, which will be a future project in this repository.
I'm still a novice focusing more on the fundamentals so I won't be pursuing it at this time.
If you're interested in building off of this, copied below is a good resource to help get you started on fixing the encryption.
Currently, the password manager will accept any master password, regardless of what you originally set it to be.
